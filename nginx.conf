#T his is the nginx configuration file used on the server
# The frontend files are placed in "var/www/html/visitor-entry-system" and served statically
# login.html serves as the root or the index file, which is first to be served

# All requests of the form /api/* are relegated to localhost:5000
# Since while designing the backend, we made the routes as /register, /login etc and not /api/register,
# we strip the "/api" part before relegating the request


# This file can be opened using : sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
# Restart nginx after making any changes here by : sudo systemctl restart nginx
